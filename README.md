# Introduction

This is a simple foundation that I use frequently either all at once or piecewise in new C++ projects.

It is a good starter project for:
- [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) - supports serialization/deserialization, compile-time enumeration of compoennt types, rendering, etc.
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - supports run-time iteration of ECS objects plus temporary storage mediums (UIStateStorage class) for providing a scratch space for ImGui input fields
- AutoFactory - This is a simple factory that simplifies the registration process to minimize boilerplate for adding new types
